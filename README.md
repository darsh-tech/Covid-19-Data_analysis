# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

A Python-based project for analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 trends, such as case numbers, recovery rates, and regional comparisons. This project utilizes powerful libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to provide insightful data visualizations and analysis.

---

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze COVID-19 trends, including daily cases, recoveries, and regional comparisons.
- **Visualization**: Generate visual representations of data such as line charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps.
- **Customization**: Adapt the code for different datasets and analysis needs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd covid19-data-analysis
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:

   - Ensure the dataset (e.g., a CSV file) is placed in the `data/` directory.
   - Update the file path in the script if necessary.

2. **Run the Analysis**:

   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

3. **View the Visualizations**:

   - Output graphs and charts will be saved in the `output/` directory.
   - Alternatively, the graphs can be displayed interactively during runtime.

## Examples

### Line Chart: Daily Cases Trend

Visualizes the daily increase in COVID-19 cases over a specified period.

### Heatmap: Regional Comparisons

Highlights the regions with the highest and lowest case densities using a heatmap.

### Bar Graph: Recovery Rates

Compares recovery rates across different countries or regions.
